Sure! Here are some production-ready serialization frameworks and tools for C++:

1. **Protocol Buffers (protobuf)** - Google's data interchange format, known for its efficiency and flexibility.
2. **FlatBuffers** - A memory-efficient serialization library designed for high-performance applications.
3. **cereal** - A C++11 library for serialization that's easy to use and integrates well with modern C++ features.
4. **yaml-cpp** - A YAML parser and emitter in C++ that's widely used for configuration files.
5. **MessagePack** - A binary serialization format that's efficient and easy to use.
6. **Boost.Serialization** - Part of the Boost C++ Libraries, offering robust serialization support.
7. **Cap'n Proto** - A serialization/RPC system that's known for its performance and flexibility.
8. **Bond** - A cross-platform framework for working with schematized data, used in high-scale services at Microsoft.
9. **Bitsery** - A binary serialization library that focuses on simplicity and performance.
10. **Cista** - A simple, high-performance, zero-copy serialization & reflection library.

These frameworks and tools are well-maintained and widely used in production environments. Do any of these catch your interest, or do you have a specific use case in mind?
