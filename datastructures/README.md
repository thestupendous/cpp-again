## Binary Search Trees
Tree data structures come in many variants, each tailored to specific use cases in computer science. Here's a breakdown of the most important types:

### 🌳 Common Tree Variants

#### 1. **Binary Tree**
- Each node has at most two children: left and right.
- Foundation for many advanced tree types.

#### 2. **Binary Search Tree (BST)**
- Left child < parent < right child.
- Enables fast search, insert, and delete operations.

#### 3. **Balanced Trees**
- Maintain height balance for efficiency.
  - **AVL Tree**: Self-balancing BST with height difference ≤ 1.
  - **Red-Black Tree**: Balances using color rules (red/black nodes).
  - **Splay Tree**: Moves accessed elements to the root for faster future access.

#### 4. **Heap Trees**
- Used in priority queues.
  - **Max Heap**: Parent ≥ children.
  - **Min Heap**: Parent ≤ children.

#### 5. **Segment Tree**
- Stores intervals for efficient range queries (e.g., sum, min, max).

#### 6. **Fenwick Tree (Binary Indexed Tree)**
- Efficient prefix sum and update operations.

#### 7. **Trie (Prefix Tree)**
- Used for string retrieval.
- Each node represents a character; paths form words.

#### 8. **B-Trees and Variants**
- Used in databases and file systems.
  - **B-Tree**: Generalized BST with multiple children.
  - **B+ Tree**: Leaf nodes linked for fast sequential access.

#### 9. **Ternary Tree**
- Each node has up to three children: left, middle, right.

#### 10. **N-ary Tree**
- Each node can have up to N children.
- Useful for representing hierarchical data like XML or file systems.
